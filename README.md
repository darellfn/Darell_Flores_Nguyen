# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# About the website

I have developed a personal website that serves as an online portfolio, where I present my CV, experience, and projects in a clear and user-friendly manner. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the React framework, and is developed with a strong focus on responsive design, clean structure, and a consistent user experience across different devices. The website is deployed online and publicly accessible, demonstrating my ability to take a project from development to production.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience with modern front-end development, component-based architecture in React, and the interaction between design and functionality. The website also reflects my technical skills, work methodology, and strong interest in continuous improvement and efficient development.

Newest version is 1.0.1
